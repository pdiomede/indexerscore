# Indexer Score Dashboard - The Graph Network

> **A simplified, delegator-focused scoring system for evaluating indexer performance on The Graph Network**

## üéØ Overview

The Indexer Score Dashboard provides a transparent and simple way to evaluate indexers based on what matters most: **query fee generation** and **fair reward sharing**. We've removed complexity to focus on the metrics that directly impact delegators' returns.

---

## ‚ú® What Makes This Score Simple

Unlike complex multi-factor scoring systems, our approach is straightforward:

- **Single Performance Metric**: Query Fee Ratio (QFR) - how efficiently an indexer generates query fees relative to their allocated stake
- **Clear Reward Requirement**: Delegator rewards percentage - how much indexers share with their delegators
- **Transparent Thresholds**: Easy-to-understand tier requirements
- **Automatic Penalties**: Built-in protections against underserving indexers

## üõ°Ô∏è Protecting Delegators

### Delegator Rewards Thresholds

The scoring system is designed to **protect delegators** by enforcing fair reward distribution:

| Delegator Rewards % | Impact | Tier Eligibility |
|---------------------|--------|------------------|
| **‚â• 30%** | ‚úÖ Fair reward sharing | Can achieve **Excellent** tier |
| **10-29%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below recommended | Maximum **Fair** tier |
| **< 10%** | üî¥ Unfair to delegators | **Automatic Poor** classification |

**Key Protection:** Any indexer sharing less than 10% of rewards with delegators is **automatically classified as Poor**, regardless of their technical performance. This ensures delegators avoid indexers who keep more than 90% of rewards for themselves.

### Supporting Informed Decisions

The dashboard helps delegators by:
- üéØ **Highlighting generous indexers** - Top tier requires ‚â•30% reward sharing
- üö´ **Filtering out unfair indexers** - Automatic Poor rating for <10% sharing
- üìä **Transparent metrics** - All data visible including exact reward percentages
- üèÜ **Easy comparison** - Sorted by tier and reward generosity

## üåê Network Health Focus

### Query Fee Ratio (QFR)

We care about the **health of The Graph Network** by evaluating indexers who actually serve the network through meaningful query fee generation.

**QFR Formula:**
```
QFR = Query Fees Earned / Total Allocated Stake
```

**Why QFR Matters:**
- Measures real network contribution through query serving
- Reflects indexer's subgraph curation quality
- Indicates actual demand for indexer's services
- Shows revenue generation capability

**Network Health Benefits:**
- Rewards indexers who serve active subgraphs
- Encourages proper subgraph selection
- Supports indexers providing value to dApp developers
- Promotes sustainable network economics

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Underserving Penalty

To maintain network decentralization and quality of service, we apply a **significant penalty** to indexers serving too few subgraphs.

### Penalty Details

**Threshold:** Indexers must serve at least **10 subgraphs**

**Penalty Formula:**
```
Penalty = 3.0 √ó (10 - number_of_subgraphs) / 10
```

**Penalty Examples:**

| Subgraphs Served | Penalty Applied | Impact |
|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 subgraph | +2.70 points | üî¥ Severe |
| 3 subgraphs | +2.10 points | üî¥ High |
| 5 subgraphs | +1.50 points | üü° Moderate |
| 7 subgraphs | +0.90 points | üü° Low |
| 10+ subgraphs | 0.00 points | ‚úÖ No penalty |

**Why This Matters:**
- Encourages network diversity
- Prevents over-concentration on few subgraphs
- Supports broader ecosystem health
- Incentivizes proper resource allocation

## üìê Score Calculation

### Step 1: Calculate QFR
```
QFR = Query Fees Earned / Allocated Stake
```

### Step 2: Normalize QFR (1-10 scale)
```
Normalized QFR = 1 + 9 √ó (min(QFR, 0.3) / 0.3)
```
- QFR capped at 0.3 (30%) for fairness
- Scale: 1 (worst) to 10 (best)

### Step 3: Invert for Final Score (1 = best, 10 = worst)
```
Final Score = 11 - Normalized QFR
```

### Step 4: Apply Underserving Penalty (if applicable)
```
If (subgraphs < 10):
    Final Score = min(10.0, Final Score + Penalty)
```

### Step 5: Assign Performance Tier
```
If (Delegator Rewards < 10%):
    Tier = Poor üî¥
Else If (Final Score ‚â§ 9.92 AND Delegator Rewards ‚â• 30%):
    Tier = Excellent üü¢
Else If (Final Score ‚â§ 9.97):
    Tier = Fair üü°
Else:
    Tier = Poor üî¥
```

---

## üìä Complete Formula

```
FINAL_SCORE = 11 - (1 + 9 √ó (min(QFR, 0.3) / 0.3)) + PENALTY

Where:
    QFR = Query Fees Earned / Allocated Stake
    PENALTY = 3.0 √ó (10 - subgraphs) / 10  (if subgraphs < 10, else 0)
    
TIER = {
    Poor üî¥:      if Delegator Rewards < 10% OR Final Score > 9.97
    Excellent üü¢: if Delegator Rewards ‚â• 30% AND Final Score ‚â§ 9.92
    Fair üü°:      otherwise
}
```

## üí° Examples

### Example 1: Excellent Indexer

**Indexer: dataservices.eth**
- Query Fees: 222,106 GRT
- Allocated Stake: 87,323,802 GRT
- Subgraphs: 930
- Delegator Rewards: 81.14%

**Calculation:**
```
QFR = 222,106 / 87,323,802 = 0.00254 (0.254%)
Normalized QFR = 1 + 9 √ó (0.00254 / 0.3) = 1.08
Final Score = 11 - 1.08 = 9.92
Penalty = 0 (serves 930 subgraphs)
Delegator Rewards = 81.14% ‚â• 30% ‚úÖ

Result: Excellent üü¢
```

**Why Excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Generates meaningful query fees
- ‚úÖ Shares 81.14% with delegators (exceptional!)
- ‚úÖ Serves many subgraphs (930)
- ‚úÖ Final score 9.92 ‚â§ threshold

---

### Example 2: Fair Indexer

**Indexer: streamingfastindexer.eth**
- Query Fees: 4,691,469 GRT
- Allocated Stake: 18,434,122 GRT
- Subgraphs: 750
- Delegator Rewards: 22.09%

**Calculation:**
```
QFR = 4,691,469 / 18,434,122 = 0.2545 (25.45%)
Normalized QFR = 1 + 9 √ó (0.2545 / 0.3) = 8.63
Final Score = 11 - 8.63 = 2.37
Penalty = 0 (serves 750 subgraphs)
Delegator Rewards = 22.09% < 30% ‚ö†Ô∏è

Result: Fair üü°
```

**Why Fair (not Excellent):**
- ‚úÖ Excellent query fee generation (top performer!)
- ‚ùå Delegator rewards 22.09% < 30% threshold
- ‚úÖ Serves many subgraphs (750)

---

### Example 3: Poor Indexer (Underserving)

**Indexer: Example Indexer**
- Query Fees: 1,000 GRT
- Allocated Stake: 5,000,000 GRT
- Subgraphs: 3
- Delegator Rewards: 35%

**Calculation:**
```
QFR = 1,000 / 5,000,000 = 0.0002 (0.02%)
Normalized QFR = 1 + 9 √ó (0.0002 / 0.3) = 1.01
Final Score = 11 - 1.01 = 9.99
Penalty = 3.0 √ó (10 - 3) / 10 = 2.10
Final Score with Penalty = min(10.0, 9.99 + 2.10) = 10.0

Result: Poor üî¥
```

**Why Poor:**
- ‚ùå Very low query fee generation
- ‚ùå Serves only 3 subgraphs (underserving)
- ‚úÖ Good delegator rewards (35%) but not enough to overcome poor performance

---

### Example 4: Poor Indexer (Low Delegator Rewards)

**Indexer: pinax2.eth**
- Query Fees: 2,856,044 GRT
- Allocated Stake: 15,999,999 GRT
- Subgraphs: 600
- Delegator Rewards: 0.00%

**Calculation:**
```
QFR = 2,856,044 / 15,999,999 = 0.1785 (17.85%)
Normalized QFR = 1 + 9 √ó (0.1785 / 0.3) = 6.36
Final Score = 11 - 6.36 = 4.64
Penalty = 0 (serves 600 subgraphs)
Delegator Rewards = 0.00% < 10% üî¥

Result: Poor üî¥ (Automatic)
```

**Why Poor:**
- ‚úÖ Excellent query fee generation (17.85%!)
- ‚úÖ Serves many subgraphs (600)
- üî¥ **AUTOMATIC POOR**: Shares 0% with delegators
- **Critical Failure**: Keeps 100% of rewards for themselves
